Community discussion, questions, and informal bug reporting is done on the \href{http://groups.google.com/group/dompdf}{\texttt{ dompdf Google group}}. You may also seek help on \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dompdf}{\texttt{ Stack\+Overflow}}.\hypertarget{md_vendor_dompdf_dompdf__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{Submitting bug reports}\label{md_vendor_dompdf_dompdf__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md24}
The preferred way to report bugs is to use the \href{http://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub issue tracker}}. Before reporting a bug, read these pointers.

{\bfseries{Please search inside the bug tracker to see if the bug you found is not already reported.}}

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} The issue tracker is for {\itshape bugs} and {\itshape feature requests}, not requests for help. Questions should be asked on the \href{http://groups.google.com/group/dompdf}{\texttt{ dompdf Google group}} instead.\hypertarget{md_vendor_dompdf_dompdf__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{Reporting bugs effectively}\label{md_vendor_dompdf_dompdf__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md25}

\item dompdf is maintained by volunteers. They don\textquotesingle{}t owe you anything, so be polite. Reports with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the bottom of the pile.
\item Include information about {\bfseries{the PHP version on which the problem occurred}}. Even if you tested several PHP version on different servers, and the problem occurred in all of them, mention this fact in the bug report. Also include the operating system it\textquotesingle{}s installed on. PHP configuration can also help, and server error logs (like Apache logs)
\item Mention which release of dompdf you\textquotesingle{}re using (the zip, the master branch, etc). Preferably, try also with the current development snapshot, to ensure the problem has not already been fixed.
\item Mention very precisely what went wrong. \char`\"{}\+X is broken\char`\"{} is not a good bug report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not fix something that we can not observe.
\item If the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in the dompdf distribution, please provide an HTML document that demonstrates the problem. There are a few options to show us your code\+:
