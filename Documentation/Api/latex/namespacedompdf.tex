Main rendering interface Currently  Dompdf\},  Dompdf\}, and  Dompdf\} implement this interface. Implementations should measure x and y increasing to the left and down, respectively, with the origin in the top left corner. Implementations are free to use a unit other than points for length, but I can\textquotesingle{}t guarantee that the results will look any good.  \href{http://dompdf.github.com/}{\texttt{ http\+://dompdf.\+github.\+com/}}  Benj Carson \href{mailto:benjcarson@digitaljunkies.ca}{\texttt{ benjcarson@digitaljunkies.\+ca}}  \href{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+gnu.\+org/copyleft/lesser.\+html}} GNU Lesser General Public License Create canvas instances The canvas factory creates canvas instances based on the availability of rendering backends and config options.

The Style class is responsible for handling and storing CSS properties. It includes methods to resolve colors and lengths, as well as getters \& setters for many CSS properites. Actual CSS parsing is performed in the  Stylesheet\} class. The master stylesheet class The Stylesheet class is responsible for parsing stylesheets and style tags/attributes. It also acts as a registry of the individual Style objects generated by the current set of loaded CSS files and style elements.  Style Dompdf -\/ PHP5 HTML to PDF renderer Dompdf loads HTML and does its best to render it as a PDF. It gets its name from the new Dom\+Document PHP5 extension. Source HTML is first parsed by a Dom\+Document object. Dompdf takes the resulting DOM tree and attaches a  Frame\} object to each node.  Frame\} objects store positioning and layout information and each has a reference to a \{ Style\} object. Style information is loaded and parsed (see  Stylesheet\}) and is applied to the frames in the tree by using XPath. CSS selectors are converted into XPath queries, and the computed  Style\} objects are applied to the  Frame\}s.  Frame\}s are then decorated (in the design pattern sense of the word) based on their CSS display property (\{ \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html\#propdef-display}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+w3.\+org/\+TR/\+CSS21/visuren.\+html\#propdef-\/display}}\}). Frame\+\_\+\+Decorators augment the basic  Frame\} class by adding additional properties and methods specific to the particular type of  Frame\}. For example, in the CSS layout model, block frames (display\+: block;) contain line boxes that are usually filled with text or other inline frames. The Block therefore adds a \$lines property as well as methods to add  Frame\}s to lines and to add additional lines.  Frame\}s also are attached to specific Abstract\+Positioner and  Abstract\+Frame\+Reflower\} objects that contain the positioining and layout algorithm for a specific type of frame, respectively. This is an application of the Strategy pattern. Layout, or reflow, proceeds recursively (post-\/order) starting at the root of the document. Space constraints (containing block width \& height) are pushed down, and resolved positions and sizes bubble up. Thus, every  Frame\} in the document tree is traversed once (except for tables which use a two-\/pass layout algorithm). If you are interested in the details, see the reflow() method of the Reflower classes. Rendering is relatively straightforward once layout is complete. \{ Frame\}s are rendered using an adapted  Cpdf\} class, originally written by Wayne Munro, \href{http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+ros.\+co.\+nz/pdf/}}. (Some performance related changes have been made to the original  Cpdf\} class, and the  Dompdf\} class provides a simple, stateless interface to PDF generation.) PDFLib support has now also been added, via the \{ Dompdf\}. Image exception thrown by DOMPDF Standard exception thrown by DOMPDF classes The font metrics class This class provides information about fonts and text. It can resolve font names into actual installed font files, as well as determine the size of text in a particular font and size. Contains frame decorating logic This class is responsible for assigning the correct  Abstract\+Frame\+Decorator\},  Abstract\+Positioner\}, and  Abstract\+Frame\+Reflower\} objects to  Frame\} objects. This is determined primarily by the Frame\textquotesingle{}s display type, but also by the Frame\textquotesingle{}s node\textquotesingle{}s type (e.\+g. Dom\+Element vs. \#text)  private Linked-\/list Iterator\+Aggregate  private Linked-\/list Iterator Returns children in order and allows for list to change during iteration, provided the changes occur to or after the current element  private Represents an entire document as a tree of frames The Frame\+Tree consists of  Frame\} objects each tied to specific DOMNode objects in a specific Dom\+Document. The Frame\+Tree has the same structure as the Dom\+Document, but adds additional capabilities for styling and layout. Pre-\/order Iterator Returns frames in preorder traversal order (parent then children)  private Pre-\/order Iterator\+Aggregate  private The main Frame class This class represents a single HTML element. This class stores positioning information as well as containing block location and dimensions. Style information for the element is stored in a \{ Style\} object. Tree structure is maintained via the parent \& children links.
